						This AN-UGC74A(V)3 was purchased on eBay, and shipped to me without a box. It came in it's original steel flight case, to which a shipping label was attached.
						It weighs over 100 pounds, and has two handles on the top for convenient carrying by two people.

						It took me over a year, but I finally tracked down a power cable for the machine, which allowed me to turn it on and get it working. The SM-D-764481 power cable
						seems to be fairly hard to find. Before I found the cable for sale, I managed to get a hold of some pdf documents detailing the entire machine, including
						the wiring diagram for the cable. I found a place where I could by the correct type of adapter, however they sell for over $70. A few months ago, I contacted
						the owner of a radio supply store that often carries military radio supplies, as they had sold one in the past. As it turned out, he had just acquired one, and
						I bought it on the spot for $20. What a deal!
