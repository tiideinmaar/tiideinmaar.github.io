          <p>
            My Baldwin SilentTouch 635 Church Organ was originally used for playing church services at Hope Summit Church in Rochester, MN.
            It had been gifted to the Church brand new by a long time member, who became the organist there. Unfortunately, after years of
            reliable service, small problems began to arise. Eventually, after renovations and improvements to the Church, it was discovered
            that the organ would not work with the new sound system. Soon after, for reasons I don't know, the organist who gifted the organ
            was no longer with the Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            After sitting unused for years, the Church made the sad decision to list the organ for sale, in as-is condition.
            In May of 2017 I made contact with Pastor Jeff M. through Craigslist, and began inquiring about the organ. Later that month, I
            drove up to Rochester with a few friends to take a look at the organ. It turned out that before I arrived, another potential
            buyer had came to take a look. They flat out told the Church that they planned to use the organ for nothing more than spare
            parts. It was decided that the Church wanted the organ to go somewhere where it could remain in use, bringing joy to others, not
            to be parted out and destroyed. If they could not find anyone who would use the organ, they would let it go to the salvager, but
            not without paying fair market value. They were willing to cut a good deal to someone who would use the organ and keep it alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I arrived, I explained to Pastor Jeff my intentions: I would take the organ into my home, where it would become my practice
            organ. I would do what I could to restore all original function. Much to my surprise, as my friends and I were looking at
            the inside, Pastor Jeff walked in and told me "By the way, if you want the organ, you can have it." He named two conditions: 1) I
            haul it out that day, and 2) I record a video of the organ once it was up and running. I decided that the problems
            that had come up through the years were likely not impossible to fix. At the time, I was a student of electrical engineering at
            Iowa State University.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unable to test the organ, as at this point it would no longer even power on, much less connect to the brand new sound system, I made
            the decision that I could repair it. My friends and I loaded the organ into a U-Haul, and it began it's journey to Ames, Iowa.
            It made a stop in Eagle Grove, Iowa, for a few days while I got ready to return to Ames. During this time, I handcrafted a copper
            plaque which reads "Kindly Gifted by Hope Summit Church of Rochester, MN" to be proudly displayed on the music desk.
            After spending three hours to get it through my door, the main fuse was replaced and the organ was plugged in and connected to a suitable
            sound system. It was time to power on the organ for the first time in years. I pressed the power switch, and nothing. It had blown
            it's new fuse. I replaced the fuse again, and once again it blew. This was not good. And so began the long process of repair and
            restoration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problems with the organ turned out to be much greater than I originally anticipated. I decided that the issue with the fuses was
            likely the fuse holder itself, as it had been worn and would short itself. I replaced it with an equivalent circuit breaker. Finally,
            the organ would power on. The next issues I discovered was in the voices. Certain voices, most notably all of the reeds, were far too
            quiet to the point where they were barely audible. Other voices exhibited a very peculiar problem by which A and Ab in certain
            octaves both sound at the same time, regardless of which of the two keys was pressed. My roommate and I took to calling this aweful
            noise the "duck".
          </p>
          <p>
            After trying and failing to repair the original voices, having no way of knowing how the organ worked, no schematics, and almost no
            resources, I decided that the only way to repair the organ was to remove all of its original and outdated electronics from the 1980s.
            In their place, a simple digital system would be custom built for the organ, giving it MIDI capability and allowing connection to
            a modern PC. From there, software such as Hauptwerk or GrandOrgue would be used to simulate some of the best pipe organs in the world
            using samples recorded from each individual pipe.

            And this is where I am at now, trying to devise a system which would do everything I need it to do, while remaining on the budget of
            a college student. At the end of the Spring 2017 semester, I completely changed directions, and became an organ major. That means I
            no longer have the electrical engineering classes or the labs at my disposal. I am on my own as far as that goes.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far, I have successfully designed and tested an Arduino Uno powered circuit which will act as the keyboard scanner, detecting
            each key press, converting that to MIDI commands, and sending the commands to an attached computer. It can also detect changes
            in expression pedals, sending that as MIDI as well. It uses 4x 8-channel multiplexer IC's to enable such a large number of required
            I/O pins to be used with a very limited microcontroller such as the Arduino Uno.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of Feb. 13, 2018, I am currently working on a similar system for scanning stops and pistons. It's most basic function is to scan
            stops and send the relevant information to the PC as MIDI commands.
            However, it must also incorporate piston functions. To any non-organists, this means it must read which stops are currently on and
            off, and be able to store that information as a preset to be recalled at the press of a specific piston, located beneath each
            keyboard. In addition to that, it must store up to 64 sets of these pistons and their relevant stop data in different memory banks
            to allow multiple organists to use the same console and each have their own set of presets. This functionality will only run locally,
            it is not necessary for it to send any of the piston information to the PC.

            Just last week, I finally finished up the circuit schematic and PCB layout. I sent the Gerber files off to a Chinese company, which
            advertised fabrication in one day and fast free shipping. The total time from order to arrival is estimated at 5 days and even at
            the low volume I need, 5 boards (minimum order), the price is unbeatable. The day after I sent them the files, I heard back that there was an error
            with them so after a small change I sent them back, and sure enough the next day the boards were fabricated. The current status is
            that the boards have cleared customs and arrived in Cincinnati, Ohio. They were meant to be delivered today, but apparently arrived
            later than expected. Hopefully they will be here tomorrow so I can begin assembly!
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time I ordered the boards, I also ordered all of the components I would need. This includes the integrated circuits, in
            this case multiplexers and resistor arrays, as well as some resistors, MIDI jacks, and terminal blocks. These components will all be
            soldered onto the PCB. I will also be making my own ribbon cables for the connections between the board and the keyboards, pedalboards,
            and other switches, and so I have 200 feet of 3M 16 conductor 26AWG ribbon cable and compatible ribbon cable headers. I've also had to
            acquire a special crimper to attach the headers to the cable itself.

            It has been a few months since I last updated this page. Since then, I discovered a critical error with my first PCB design. Just before
            I ordered the boards, I made a change to the multiplexer template. I mistakenly thought that the pin layout remained the same, and I did 
            not double check. Unfortunately, one side of the IC had it's pins flipped, making it completely unusable. I fixed my error and ordered 
            version 2, which I soldered together for testing. This time, it worked!
          </p>
          <p>
            My problem now is inherent to how I designed the board. I had originally thought I would use a seperate system for reading the stops 
            and pistons, as I described in my last update. It follows that I designed the board with that in mind, which means that I only allowed 
            it enough inputs to cover the two manuals and the pedalboard, plus 38 extras. However, I no longer believe that to be the best option. 
            In order to use my system to control the entire organ, meaning the two manuals (61 keys each), the pedalboard (32 pedals), 
            the pistons (about 28), the stops (48 total), and the stop cancels (3 divisionals, 1 general), I will need to redisign the board yet 
            again. This means either more multiplexers, or larger multiplexers such as 16-channel instead of 8-channel. The expression pedals 
            are controlled directly from the Arduino, supporting up to 6 potentiometers, or other microcontroller as I will discuss below which 
            may vary in how many potentiometers it will handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also run into the issue of latency. The Arduino Uno runs at 16MHz, though I can potentially push that to 20MHz if I physically 
            modify the hardware by adding a new crystal oscillator. I did a small test to determine just how much latency I could expect, and I 
            was getting upwards of 80ms delay between pressing a key and the computer registering the key press. It doesn't sound like much, but 
            it is enough to mess up the organist's rhythm and make it impossible to play well. My latest attempt, which I have tested with a single 
            keyboard using my previous PCB's, will use a Teensy 3.2 board, which is an ARM microcontroller running around 75MHz if I remember 
            correctly. It has some latency, though it is fairly unnoticeable and certainly bearable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final potential solution to my problem is to redisign the circuit entirely. Rather than using multiplexers, I could use shift 
            registers. This could theoretically speed up the scanner 800% by scanning 8 inputs per operation as opposed to only 1 input per 
            operation. I hesitate to try this for multiple reasons. The first is that I simply have no experience with shift registers, and very 
            little in designing electronics like this in general. The other reason is that I have already spent more money on the project than I 
            would like, and cannot afford to waste money by starting over. Only time will tell what I will decide, but I will update this page 
            once again as soon as I have progress to share.
