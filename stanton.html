                        Margaret McDonald Stanton passed away on July 24, 1895. Both she and her husband, Edgar Stanton, were faculty 
						members at Iowa College of Agriculture, now known as Iowa State University. Though tragic for the time, it is 
						because of her passing that the I.S.U. campus is graced by the presence of the Edgar W. and Margaret MacDonald 
						Stanton Memorial Carillon. The following article was originally printed in the July 30, 1895 
						edition of the I.A.C. Student, the school paper at the time, and was transcribed in it's entirety by myself. 
						The scans of the article are original scans from microfiche from the Parks Library on campus.

					<u>AT REST.</u>
					<p>The opening of the present college term is shrouded with a pall of profound sorrow at the death of Mrs. Stanton. 
					By her perfect womanliness, by her sweet sympathy with those in distress or those in gladness, by her earnest wishes 
					and efforts for the best welfare of the college she has endeared herself to everyone with whom she has come in 
					contact and as today we sadly bow before the relentless hand of the Great Destroyer we mourn the loss of one who was 
					universally recognized as one of the truest friends of the students of I. A. C.
					<p>Margaret McDonald Stanton was born in New Concord, Muskingam Co., Ohio, in 1845. When eighteen years of age she 
					came with her parents to an Iowa home at Mt. Pleasant. Having spent three years in Muskingam College she later 
					attended and was graduated from the Mt. Pleasant Female Seminary. She came to the Iowa Agricultural college in 1871, 
					as a member of its first faculty being preceptress and teacher of French and English. She was married to Prof. E. W. 
					Stanton in February 1877. She was very successful as a teacher and was loved for her devotion and tact in the varied 
					duties she was called upon to perform. She bore her late illness with patience and fortitude and for a while was 
					confident in the skill of Dr. Fairchild to restore her to health, but realizing at last that she must leave her loved 
					ones, she calmly resigned herself to the will of the Divine Providence.
					<p>Mrs. Stanton died on Thursday evening July 25th. The funeral services were held in the College Chapel on Sunday 
					morning in place of the usual Sunday morning services. The entire body of students was drawn up in a line facing west 
					and extending from Morrill Hall to the President's Office. The pall-bearers were Professors Franklin, Bennett, Stalker, 
					Osborn, and Messrs Greely and M. K. Smith, of East Ames; Messrs. Oliver, Davidson, Schulte, Walker, Wright and Lazell. 
					of the Senior Class acted as bearers.
					<p>The College Faculty and the Ames Chapter of the P. E. O. Society, of which Mrs. Stanton was a member followed the 
					family and relatives to the chapel. The students then took their places by classes in the main part of the chapel, the 
					gallery being more than filled by citizens of East Ames and Nevada. Among those present from abroad were Mr. and Mrs. 
					Homer Boardman, of Nevada, Hon. O. D. Boardman, of Des Moines, Trustee A. B. Shaw and wife, of Corning, Trustee C. F. 
					Saylor, of Des Moines, Judge Stevens and wife of Boone, Dr. Fairchild, wife and daughters, of Clinton, Mr. and Mrs. 
					Hardin, of Eldora and Mrs. Macomber, of Des Moines.
