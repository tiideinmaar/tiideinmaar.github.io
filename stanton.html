            Margaret McDonald Stanton passed away on July 24, 1895. Both she and her husband, Edgar Stanton, were faculty
            members at Iowa Agricultural College, now known as Iowa State University. Though her untimely death was a tragedy for such a small and close-knit community, it is
            Only for this reason reason that the I.S.U. campus is graced by the presence of the Edgar W. and Margaret McDonald
            Stanton Memorial Carillon. This page is dedicated to Margaret and Edgar Stanton, and will include several articles and items which I have referenced for my research.
The following article was originally printed in the July 30, 1895
            edition of the I.A.C. Student, the school paper at the time, and was transcribed in it's entirety by myself.

          <u>AT REST.</u>
          <p>
            The opening of the present college term is shrouded with a pall of profound sorrow at the death of Mrs. Stanton.
            By her perfect womanliness, by her sweet sympathy with those in distress or those in gladness, by her earnest wishes
            and efforts for the best welfare of the college she has endeared herself to everyone with whom she has come in
            contact and as today we sadly bow before the relentless hand of the Great Destroyer we mourn the loss of one who was
            universally recognized as one of the truest friends of the students of I. A. C.
          </p>
          <p>
            Margaret McDonald Stanton was born in New Concord, Muskingam Co., Ohio, in 1845. When eighteen years of age she
            came with her parents to an Iowa home at Mt. Pleasant. Having spent three years in Muskingam College she later
            attended and was graduated from the Mt. Pleasant Female Seminary. She came to the Iowa Agricultural college in 1871,
            as a member of its first faculty being preceptress and teacher of French and English. She was married to Prof. E. W.
            Stanton in February 1877. She was very successful as a teacher and was loved for her devotion and tact in the varied
            duties she was called upon to perform. She bore her late illness with patience and fortitude and for a while was
            confident in the skill of Dr. Fairchild to restore her to health, but realizing at last that she must leave her loved
            ones, she calmly resigned herself to the will of the Divine Providence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Stanton died on Thursday evening July 25th. The funeral services were held in the College Chapel on Sunday
            morning in place of the usual Sunday morning services. The entire body of students was drawn up in a line facing west
            and extending from Morrill Hall to the President's Office. The pall-bearers were Professors Franklin, Bennett, Stalker,
            Osborn, and Messrs Greely and M. K. Smith, of East Ames; Messrs. Oliver, Davidson, Schulte, Walker, Wright and Lazell.
            of the Senior Class acted as bearers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The College Faculty and the Ames Chapter of the P. E. O. Society, of which Mrs. Stanton was a member followed the
            family and relatives to the chapel. The students then took their places by classes in the main part of the chapel, the
            gallery being more than filled by citizens of East Ames and Nevada. Among those present from abroad were Mr. and Mrs.
            Homer Boardman, of Nevada, Hon. O. D. Boardman, of Des Moines, Trustee A. B. Shaw and wife, of Corning, Trustee C. F.
            Saylor, of Des Moines, Judge Stevens and wife of Boone, Dr. Fairchild, wife and daughters, of Clinton, Mr. and Mrs.
            Hardin, of Eldora and Mrs. Macomber, of Des Moines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gen. Lincoln, and Professors Jas, Wilson, Bissell, Ford, and Doolittle were appointed by Dr. Beardshear as committee
            on arrangements and carried out their work very successfully. Gen. Lincoln was given the entire management of the
            ceremonies and performed his work with characteristic ability and thoroughness. Forming a background to the casket,
            which was itself covered with cut flowers, were a large variety of floral designs among which were a large cross given
            by the faculty. The Gates Ajar, a tribute from the P. E. O. society, a large boquet of white roses, white lilies, and
            ferns and also a pillow from the Cliolian Literary Society, a star from the Bachelor society, a pillow from the
            Y. W. C. A., a wreath from the firm of Biglow & Smith, a harp of pink roses from Mr. and Mrs. Brown, of Des Moines,
            together with a profusion of cut flowers, offered by the students and other friends of the family. Unfortunately the
            flowers ordered from Chicago by the Cresent Society and by some of the classes did not arrive in time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Wynn delivered the discourse which was followed by a very appropriate address from President Beardshear. The
            singing by the college choir was beautiful and impressive as was also Miss Westermann's voluntary. Miss Chambers sang
            as a solo that beautiful hymn, Lead Kindly Light, very sweetly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arriving at the cemetery the students formed a circle around the relatives, faculty, choir and P. E. O. society. The
            grave had been very beautifully lined by the P. E. O's. Dr. Beardshear read a short burial service, after which the
            P. E. O's. sang their Closing Ode and their chaplain offered the beautiful prayer from their ritual. The choir sang
            "The Beautiful Land" and then the large throng walked slowly and sadly back to the college.

          <p>
            My Friends:--In attempting to address you upon this occasion I fear lest my words may be too few or too many. The
            memories of other days and scenes together with a full consciousness of an irreparable and abiding loss may urge
            one's sympathies to the thwarting of thought and due expression. Should words be given they may not be
            fraighted with love, esteem, and truth adequate to the character and memory of her who reigns supreme in our affection.
            Though language is experienced with life's weightiest sorrows and richest loves, and with God;s fullest thought to man;
            yet when of a dear one the golden bowl is broken and the silver cord is loosed our words sink to the earth under the burden
            of our pierced love and growing loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is an interesting study of our lives to observe the characterful impression, of serious events both private and public.
            They often take the rarest hue of earth and sky. On last Thursday evening at the time of our beloved friend's departure for
            the good home in the skies, there was a remarkable spactacle of nature. To the north-ward there was the fiercest thunder cloud
            storm vivified with the intensest and frequentest lightnings that I have observed for many a day. North-ward with the storm
            was destruction and death, but to the west-ward was the clear sky, sealed with heaven's own blue. The new moon and evening
            star vied with each other in a silent beauty and a prophetic cheer which with the peculiar back-ground and environment
            clothed nature with an unusual awe. Theses strikingly companion scenes under the consciousness of our great loss made upon
            me a profound and helpful impression. In the north there was maddening lightning, coldness and death, but even above the
            hidden sun in the west there was light, prophecy, fidelity and cheer. These nature pictures express our mingled emotions this
            hour, but the life, faith, character, and good-bye messages of our departed friend lead us unmistakably, even amid the gloom
            of our loss, to place emphasis upon the hope and the promise of the picture in the western sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            What a day of mingled life, sacred emotion and happy surprise is that of birth in a home! Such a day was Oct. 22nd. 1845 in
            the home of Mr. and Mrs. James McDonald, of New Concord, Ohio, when a girl child came from heaven to earth to bless them and
            destined to brighten the lives of many others in years to come. They named her Margaret, a name soon to become a poem of truest
            memories and riches beneficences to friends and loved ones. Her childhood had the fortunate setting of a christian home. The
            teachings of that early life entered into her character with a heaven-born sway. Who but the recording angel can know the pages
            in the book of our earlier years. The words, the kindnesses, the plays, the mother-hood, the father-hood, the providences,
            human and divine, make, to the thoughtful, a collect of extraordinary interest and worth. Whatever our conception as to our
            derivative parental endowments, we instantly feel a truth in the poem of Wordsworth:<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
            &emsp;"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;The sould that rises with us, our life's star,<br>
            &emsp;Hath had elsewhere it's setting,<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;And cometh from afar:<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Not in entire forgetfulness,<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And not in utter nakeness,<br>
            &emsp;But trailing clouds of glory do we come.<br>
            &emsp;From God, who is our home,<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Heaven lies about us in our infancy.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;I raise<br>
            &emsp;The song of thanks and praise<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For those first affections.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Those shadowy recollections,<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Which be they what they may,<br>
            &emsp;Are yet the fountain light of all our day,<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Are yet a master light of all our seeing."<br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            The childlife of our friend gave most pleasing expression of the truest forms and noblest embodiments of youthful life and
            character. Her early years were placed on the border land of North and South in the evenful period of American history wherein the
            great struggle of slavery was determining for a higher national purpose and life. The fierce discussions and early battles of
            the war, only led her to a profounder love for humanity and a deeper trust in God.
          </p>
          <p>
            The patriotic and humanitarian sentiments of that time became large motive powers in leading her to the Christian church, so
            that at the age of sixteen, she identified herself with the Presbyterian church at Claysville, Ohio. This local church organization
            had become characterized by its adherence to the freedom of man and the cause of the union. Her parents and she went some six miles
            from home to be identified with the church, whose pastor, Rev. Matthew Miller, had become prominent in his words for the union.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a formal beginning of a christian life and character that strengthened with the years, beautified with its joys and sorrows
            and triumphed through its losses and trials. How true it is that a well spent youth is an indispensable foundation of the most
            successful and useful life. She early felt the importance of a higher education. After having shared the noble influence of the
            public schools, America's bulwark, and our youth's divine safe-guard, she become a student in Muckingham College. In this college
            Pres. Harper now of Chicago University was then a student. She here laid the foundation for thoroughness of learning that marked
            her most creditable career of after years. Her parents moved west in 1864 and located near Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. This necessitated
            the severing of her connection with the College in Ohio. She soon thereafter became a student in Mt. Pleasant Seminary, an
            institution presided over by Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Beldon, whose sterling character and sound learning gave greatest worth and front
            rank to this educational institution. It was in that memorable period of Iowa education in which the corner stones were placed
            for our most creditable system of higher education, when learning for learning's sake and the soul's sake was imparted by men and
            women that loved man and revered God. Our friend shared these exalted purposes of a higher education, became a leading student of
            the seminary and graduated with honor to herself and friends. She was thus enabled to add to a well spent youth the preparation
            of a christian education. This spirit of sterling education she carried with her as a teacher in the public schools. Her efficiency
            as a teacher and her worth as a woman soon attracted the attention of those forming a faculty for the Iowa Agricultural College. In
            1870 she was elect as lady Preceptress and Professor of French and English in this institution. From the first she made a marked
            impression upon her associates and students. In those days the College did not have as many buildings as now. There was no hospital
            and there were many consequent inconveniences. The sick had to be cared for in their own rooms. As is often true, such an environment
            became a source of revealing the most exalted character of society. Miss McDonald possessed the very qualities that would meet these
            difficulties and turn them into triumphs and blessings. The students came to look upon her as their truest friend. She visited the
            rooms of the boys and girls alike in their sickness and all felt at home in her presence and ennobled by her ministry. Those early
            students of the college came to look upon her as if a patron saint, whose beck to duty was a privilege and whose teaching a blessing.
            The older alumni and undergraduates of those years speak of her with a reverence that can only be born in the work and service
            of a true teacher, of the genuine woman and the unselfish devotion of a Christ-like disciple. Men and women in the most varied
            positions of life and responsibility, to the governor and his wife of the great state of Iowa, join in these hours with most
            grateful tribute to her kindness and ministry during their student life. The qualities that made her so successful as preceptress
            became strongest factors in imprinting her personality upon the students in the classroom. No teaching is half done that leaves
            out the wholesome personality of the teacher. In this respect our friend imprinted indelibly her strong personality upon the
            student. No teaching is efficiently done that depends too largely upon the personality and lacks in the formal presentation of
            the text and the truth. In this, also, our friend was most successful. Her teaching was characterized by the completest
            thoroughness - a thoroughness that entered into the smaller details and accuracies which determine the perfection of scholarship
            and the integrity of learning. These strong points of a masterful teacher carried with them their attendant virtues and made her
            life in the college faculty one of the most memorable of its ablest members.
          </p>
          <p>
            During these years she found means and time to help the friends at home in Mt. Pleasant. Many of you know the early struggles
            incident to our fathers and mothers in purchasing lands and building homes on these prairies of Iowa. Father and mother McDonald
            with thousands of others of our most stable pioneers encountered such early hardships. Our departed friend gave largely of her salary
            and devoted a number of her years to the freeing of the farm and the placing of the homestead on the mount of a new freedom and
            fuller blessing. The spirit of her parents that had led to her own education was thoroughly imbibed and her aid in these years also
            helped to make possible the education and larger life of the remaining children of the family. This thoughtfulness and provision
            for others rather than for herself was a marked characteristic of her entire life. It is the spirit of a true heroine.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a time of life too often the subject of pleasantry and thoughtlessness in poetry, song and parlor exchange, yet, it has
            about it the bloom of many springs and a hallowedness that renders it appropriately mentionable during these solemn experiences.
            The Hebrew sages under divine illumination were nearer the truth in making the obligation of betrothal scarcely second to marriage
            itself, This college period of marked usefulness in the life of our friend was also a time of her betrothal to an associate member
            of the faculty. Her large womanhood and deep sense of life's meanings needed no constraint of custom or sage to meet with womanly
            sense these new found joys and expectancies that make the noblest life still nobler. On Fubruary 22nd, 1877 she was united in
            marriage with Prof. E. W. Stanton, then as now Professor of Mathematics of the Iowa Agricultural College. After her married life
            she taught for two years and of her own accord gave up her teaching to give herself more fully to the building of their new home
            and meeting the fuller relations of life. For eight years she thus directly shared the counsel bore the burdens and helped to mould
            the high born destinies of this college.
          </p>
          <p>
            Home life is capable of infinite expansion and variation. It nourishes and yet reveals life and character. The cardinal virtues
            that had made her so much in the profession of teaching, now had a larger realm for her as wife and mother. The years of her married
            life gained double meaning by the birth of four children, three of whom live with the father on earth and one with the mother in
            heaven. She brought to the home an institution which was almost unerring. To woman's proverbial intuition she had an added gift that
            made her judgment of men and things of vast practical value to herself and family. Coupled with it was an independence of thought
            and decision of character that made her a tower of strength to all the members of the family and to the community. Her love and
            devotion to the family were most beautiful. Her thought was always of others and not of herself. Her clearness and firmness
            of judgment freed her of many cares and worries that so often fret the life and tire the soul. Her patience and endurance surpassed
            every demand and rendered her a fountain of never failing strenth and cheer. It kept out impatient words and brought whole trains
            of happy scenes and joyful hours. Her entire home life was most happy and markedly free from anything that would mar or sadden.
            She believed with Ruskin that: "Our God is a household God, as well as a heaven-one, He has an altar in every man's dwelling," and
            to this altar she daily led her household and at this altar gave them her final good-byes and consecrations for the years to come.
            She was a noble wife and the truest of mothers.
          </p>
          <p>
            No stronger encomium of her as a mother could possibly be uttered than that of her own child when she said, "I never can do anything
            wrong when I think of mamma." Nor of her as a wife by the husband, "It was heavenly to live with her." Yea, friends, what is heaven
            but the eternal communion of kindred souls. And of her as a daughter and sister when all her father's family harmoniously unite in
            saying: "We all looked to Maggie as a main stay."
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
            &emsp;"There are three words that sweetly blend,<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;That on the heart are graven;<br>
            &emsp;A precious, soothing balm they lend-<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;They're mother, home and heaven.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;They twine a wreath of beauteous flowers,<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Which, placed on memory's urn,<br>
            &emsp;Will e'en the longest, gloomiest hours<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;To golden sunlight turn.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;They form a chain whose every link<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Is free from base alloy;<br>
            &emsp;A stream where whosoever drinks<br>
            &emsp;Will find refreshing joy."<br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            As could be expected such a home life entered into all her duties in the community and made her one of its most valuable members.
            As a neighbor she was ever ready in sickness and in health to administer to the welfare of the humblest or strongest members of
            society. In the benefactions that have to do with the relief of the poor, the comfort of the sick, and sympathies with the joys
            and presperities of other homes, she stood a model.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her deep convictions of truth and high regard of honor gave her a detestation of everything that was wrong. Her keen discernment
            of right and wrong rendered her unswervingly faithful to the truth. She never temporized with evil nor believed in policy. She
            possessed the happy faculty of denouncing wrong without harboring bitterness for the person guilty of the wrong. She could thus
            enter most righteously and helpfully into the life of the wrong doer. It kept her mind free from the ills consequent upon the
            personal faulting of anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            She was most patriotic. In early girl hood her country's cause was near her heart. The union soldier was held by her in highest
            reverences. For any one to speak lightly in regard to the pension of the soldier would bestir her with most womanly indignation.
            She counted the needy soldiery of the country most worth of all the help the country might bestow upon them. Memorial Day was

            I take no ownership of the scans below. They were scanned by myself during my ongoing research at the Iowa State University Archives, located in the Parks Library on campus.
            Each page consists of two separate high-definition scans, which were stitched together by myself. I am in the process of cleaning up page 1 to make it more readable, and will update this
            page as I progress.
