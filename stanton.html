                        Margaret McDonald Stanton passed away on July 24, 1895. Both she and her husband, Edgar Stanton, were faculty 
						members at Iowa Agricultural College, now known as Iowa State University. Though tragic for the time, it is 
						because of her passing that the I.S.U. campus is graced by the presence of the Edgar W. and Margaret MacDonald 
						Stanton Memorial Carillon. The following article was originally printed in the July 30, 1895 
						edition of the I.A.C. Student, the school paper at the time, and was transcribed in it's entirety by myself. 
						The scans of the article are original scans from microfiche from the Parks Library on campus.

					<u>AT REST.</u>
					<p>The opening of the present college term is shrouded with a pall of profound sorrow at the death of Mrs. Stanton. 
					By her perfect womanliness, by her sweet sympathy with those in distress or those in gladness, by her earnest wishes 
					and efforts for the best welfare of the college she has endeared herself to everyone with whom she has come in 
					contact and as today we sadly bow before the relentless hand of the Great Destroyer we mourn the loss of one who was 
					universally recognized as one of the truest friends of the students of I. A. C.
					<p>Margaret McDonald Stanton was born in New Concord, Muskingam Co., Ohio, in 1845. When eighteen years of age she 
					came with her parents to an Iowa home at Mt. Pleasant. Having spent three years in Muskingam College she later 
					attended and was graduated from the Mt. Pleasant Female Seminary. She came to the Iowa Agricultural college in 1871, 
					as a member of its first faculty being preceptress and teacher of French and English. She was married to Prof. E. W. 
					Stanton in February 1877. She was very successful as a teacher and was loved for her devotion and tact in the varied 
					duties she was called upon to perform. She bore her late illness with patience and fortitude and for a while was 
					confident in the skill of Dr. Fairchild to restore her to health, but realizing at last that she must leave her loved 
					ones, she calmly resigned herself to the will of the Divine Providence.
					<p>Mrs. Stanton died on Thursday evening July 25th. The funeral services were held in the College Chapel on Sunday 
					morning in place of the usual Sunday morning services. The entire body of students was drawn up in a line facing west 
					and extending from Morrill Hall to the President's Office. The pall-bearers were Professors Franklin, Bennett, Stalker, 
					Osborn, and Messrs Greely and M. K. Smith, of East Ames; Messrs. Oliver, Davidson, Schulte, Walker, Wright and Lazell. 
					of the Senior Class acted as bearers.
					<p>The College Faculty and the Ames Chapter of the P. E. O. Society, of which Mrs. Stanton was a member followed the 
					family and relatives to the chapel. The students then took their places by classes in the main part of the chapel, the 
					gallery being more than filled by citizens of East Ames and Nevada. Among those present from abroad were Mr. and Mrs. 
					Homer Boardman, of Nevada, Hon. O. D. Boardman, of Des Moines, Trustee A. B. Shaw and wife, of Corning, Trustee C. F. 
					Saylor, of Des Moines, Judge Stevens and wife of Boone, Dr. Fairchild, wife and daughters, of Clinton, Mr. and Mrs. 
					Hardin, of Eldora and Mrs. Macomber, of Des Moines.
					<p>Gen. Lincoln, and Professors Jas, Wilson, Bissell, Ford, and Doolittle were appointed by Dr. Beardshear as committee 
					on arrangements and carried out their work very successfully. Gen. Lincoln was given the entire management of the 
					ceremonies and performed his work with characteristic ability and thoroughness. Forming a background to the casket, 
					which was itself covered with cut flowers, were a large variety of floral designs among which were a large cross given 
					by the faculty. The Gates Ajar, a tribute from the P. E. O. society, a large boquet of white roses, white lilies, and 
					ferns and also a pillow from the Cliolian Literary Society, a star from the Bachelor society, a pillow from the 
					Y. W. C. A., a wreath from the firm of Biglow & Smith, a harp of pink roses from Mr. and Mrs. Brown, of Des Moines, 
					together with a profusion of cut flowers, offered by the students and other friends of the family. Unfortunately the 
					flowers ordered from Chicago by the Cresent Society and by some of the classes did not arrive in time.
					<p>Dr. Wynn delivered the discourse which was followed by a very appropriate address from President Beardshear. The 
					singing by the college choir was beautiful and impressive as was also Miss Westermann's voluntary. Miss Chambers sang 
					as a solo that beautiful hymn, Lead Kindly Light, very sweetly.
					<p>Arriving at the cemetery the students formed a circle around the relatives, faculty, choir and P. E. O. society. The 
					grave had been very beautifully lined by the P. E. O's. Dr. Beardshear read a short burial service, after which the 
					P. E. O's. sang their Closing Ode and their chaplain offered the beautiful prayer from their ritual. The choir sang 
					"The Beautiful Land" and then the large throng walked slowly and sadly back to the college.

					<u>DR. BEARDSHEAR'S ADDRESS.</u>
					<br>
					<p>My Friends:--In attempting to address you upon this occasion I fear lest my words may be too few or too many. The 
					memories of other days and scenes together with a full consciousness of an irreparable and abiding loss may urge 
					one's sympathies to the thwarting of thought and due expression. Should words be given they may not be 
					fraighted with love, esteem, and truth adequate to the character and memory of her who reigns supreme in our affection. 
					Though language is experienced with life's weightiest sorrows and richest loves, and with God;s fullest thought to man; 
					yet when of a dear one the golden bowl is broken and the silver cord is loosed our words sink to the earth under the burden 
					of our pierced love and growing loss.
					<p>It is an interesting study of our lives to observe the characterful impression, of serious events both private and public. 
					They often take the rarest hue of earth and sky. On last Thursday evening at the time of our beloved friend's departure for 
					the good home in the skies, there was a remarkable spactacle of nature. To the north-ward there was the fiercest thunder cloud 
					storm vivified with the intensest and frequentest lightnings that I have observed for many a day. North-ward with the storm 
					was destruction and death, but to the west-ward was the clear sky, sealed with heaven's own blue. The new moon and evening 
					star vied with each other in a silent beauty and a prophetic cheer which with the peculiar back-ground and environment 
					clothed nature with an unusual awe. Theses strikingly companion scenes under the consciousness of our great loss made upon 
					me a profound and helpful impression. In the north there was maddening lightning, coldness and death, but even above the 
					hidden sun in the west there was light, prophecy, fidelity and cheer. These nature pictures express our mingled emotions this 
					hour, but the life, faith, character, and good-bye messages of our departed friend lead us unmistakably, even amid the gloom 
					of our loss, to place emphasis upon the hope and the promise of the picture in the western sky.
					<p>What a day of mingled life, sacred emotion and happy surprise is that of birth in a home! Such a day was Oct. 22nd. 1845 in 
					the home of Mr. and Mrs. James McDonald, of New Concord, Ohio, when a girl child came from heaven to earth to bless them and 
					destined to brighten the lives of many others in years to come. They named her Margaret, a name soon to become a poem of truest 
					memories and riches beneficences to friends and loved ones. Her childhood had the fortunate setting of a christian home. The 
					teachings of that early life entered into her character with a heaven-born sway. Who but the recording angel can know the pages 
					in the book of our earlier years. The words, the kindnesses, the plays, the mother-hood, the father-hood, the providences, 
					human and divine, make, to the thoughtful, a collect of extraordinary interest and worth. Whatever our conception as to our 
					derivative parental endowments, we instantly feel a truth in the poem of Wordsworth:<br>
					<p>"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:<br>The sould that rises with us, our life's star,<br>Hath had elsewhere it's setting,
					<br>And cometh from afar:<br>Not in entire forgetfulness,<br>And not in utter nakeness,<br>But trailing clouds of glory do we come.<br>
					From God, who is our home,<br>Heaven lies about us in our infancy.<br> * * * * I raise<br>The song of thanks and praise<br>
					 * * * * * <br>For those first affections.<br>Those shadowy recollections,<br>Which be they what they may,<br>Are yet the fountain light 
					 of all our day,<br>Are yet a master light of all our seeing."<br>
					 <p>The childlife of our friend gave most pleasing expression of the truest forms and noblest embodiments of youthful life and 
					 character. Her early years were placed on the border land of North and South in the evenful period of American history wherein the 
					 great struggle of slavery was determining for a higher national purpose and life. The fierce discussions and early battles of 
					 the war, only led her to a profounder love for humanity and a deeper trust in God.
					 <p>The patriotic and humanitarian sentiments of that time became large motive powers in leading her to the Christian church, so 
					 that at the age of sixteen, she identified herself with the Presbyterian church at Claysville, Ohio. This local church organization 
					 had become characterized by its adherence to the freedom of man and the cause of the union. Her parents and she went some six miles 
					 from home to be identified with the church, whose pastor, Rev. Matthew Miller, had become prominent in his words for the union.
